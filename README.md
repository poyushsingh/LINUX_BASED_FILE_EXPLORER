# LINUX_BASED_FILE_EXPLORER

Objective:
Build a fully functional File Explorer Application, with a restricted feature set.

Prerequisites:
1. Basic usage and architectural know-how of file explorer features
2. Preliminaries such as C/C++ code compilation, execution & debugging.

Requirements:
Your File Explorer should work in two modes :-
1. Normal mode (default mode) - used to explore the current directory and navigate the filesystem
2. Command mode - used to enter shell commands
The root of your application should be the same as the system, and the home of the application should
be the same as home of the current user.
The application should display data starting from the top-left corner of the terminal window, line-by-
line. You should be able to handle text rendering if the terminal window is resized. The last line of the
display screen is to be used as a status bar.
